 --- 不要抱歉
 --- Oh, don't be.
 --- 好了
 --- Okay.
 --- 从现在开始
 --- From here on out,
 --- 我们要采取非常不同的上课方式
 --- we're gonna do things very, very differently.
 --- 所以  那些完全没兴趣
 --- So for those of you who are not even remotely interested
 --- 坐在这里的人  请你们离开
 --- in being here, please leave.
 --- 很简单  只要走出这扇门
 --- Just simply walk out the door
 --- 你就自动得到一个C
 --- and you'll receive an automatic C.
 --- 我已经没多少时间可以浪费了
 --- I no longer have time to be wasted
 --- 我也不想浪费你们的
 --- nor do I intend on wasting yours.
 --- 所以  那些得过C
 --- So for those of you who receive grades of,
 --- 或更低成绩的人  就主动点
 --- say, a C or worse, let's just be proactive.
 --- 收拾好东西  现在就赶紧走人
 --- Pack up your shit. And vamos now.
 --- 很好  这就对了
 --- Good. Here we go.
 --- 你们之中如果有人打算以后去学商科
 --- If any of you have any intentions of studying business,
 --- 现在就给我滚出去
 --- get the fuck out now.
 --- 我只说这一遍
 --- I'm not gonna say it again.
 --- 如果你们低下头正好看到自己穿的是运动裤
 --- If you look down and you happen to find yourself in sweatpants
 --- 或是任何有抽绳之类的裤子
 --- or rather pants with the drawstring or something,
 --- -慢走不送  -什么
 --- - just please leave. - What?
 --- 最重要的一点  如果你们从未
 --- Most important of all, if you've never read a book
 --- 出于内心的愉悦去阅读一本书
 --- for our own internal pleasure...
 --- 那你们就不属于这里  出去
 --- you don't belong here. Get out.
 --- 如果你们之中有人
 --- If any of you find yourself
 --- 属于以上类别之一
 --- falling into any of these categories,
 --- 我向你们保证  你们的成绩不会高于C
 --- I assure you, you will not do better than a C.
 --- 这就对了
 --- Here we go.
 --- 政府公务员和政客都走了
 --- The government workers and the politicians included.
 --- 运动裤那段话不是开玩笑
 --- The, uh, sweatpants comment is not a joke.
 --- 我生病了  我感冒了
 --- I'm sick. I have a cold.
 --- 好了  现在  那些有兴趣
 --- Right. Now, for those of you who are interested
 --- 向伟大的灵魂学习的人
 --- in learning from greater minds,
 --- 那么请你们这学季读一本书
 --- and there are today, you're in charge of reading one book
 --- 只读这一本
 --- and one book only to this quarter.
 --- 读完之后  你就站在讲台上
 --- After doing so, you will then stand up here
 --- 自己来讲一堂课
 --- and you will run a class of your own.
 --- 很好  只动嘴不动手的也走了
 --- Excellent. There go the kings and queens of the water cooler,
 --- 未来的企业蛀虫
 --- corporate whores of tomorrow.
 --- C  还是算了吧
 --- C. Maybe not.
 --- 然后你们就请站上讲台  告诉同学们
 --- And then you will stand up here and you'll persuade your peers
 --- 这本书的重要性
 --- of the work's importance.
 --- 做到这一点  你们就能得B
 --- For that, you'll receive a B.
 --- 如果你教了我们新知识  就能得A
 --- If you teach us something new, you receive an A.
 --- 还有什么问题吗
 --- Any questions?
 --- 对了  还有一件事
 --- Ah-ha. Yes. One more thing.
 --- 不要宣扬女权或是同性恋
 --- No feminist or queer propaganda.
 --- 说真的  邋遢凌乱的女人们面对的困境
 --- The plight of unkempt women is truly the last thing
 --- 是我现在最不想知道的东西
 --- I would like to think about right now.
 --- 我认为你无权这么做
 --- I don't think you can do that.
 --- 我就这么做了
 --- I just did.
 --- 现在  我要在接下来的72小时里放飞自我
 --- And now, I shall embark on an emotional...bender for 72 hours.
 --- 我多半会独自饮酒
 --- Most likely, I'll be drinking alone
 --- 而我对此感觉良好
 --- and I'm all right with that.
 --- 所以本节课就取消了
 --- So as a result, class is cancelled.
 --- 我说完了
 --- That's it.
 --- 下课
 --- Class dismissed.
 --- 对了如果你们有人卖大麻
