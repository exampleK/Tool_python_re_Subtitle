17
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,080
情况并不乐观  理查德 3
It doesn't look good, Richard. 4

18
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,590
事实上跟你说实话  情况很严重 8
In fact, to be quite frank, it looks pretty bad.9

19
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,080
我就不拐弯抹角了 13 
Rather than beat around the bush, 14

20
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,750
跟你说实话吧 18 
I'm just gonna come right out and say it. 19

21
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,680
理查德  你患了肺癌  已经到了四期	
Richard, you have stage four lung cancer.

22
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,240
一直困扰你的上背部疼痛
The pain you've been experiencing in your upper back

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,560
其实是你肺部的恶性肿瘤造成的
is actually the result of malignant tumors within your lungs,

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,420
根据这点来看  你已经患癌很长一段时间了
which it sadly appears you have for some time.

25
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,450
现在查出来已经有点晚了
As we're catching this late in the game,

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,800
你的癌细胞仍有可能会扩散
your cancer has also had the opportunity to spread

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,900
尤其是扩散到你的脊柱和肾上腺
specifically to your spine, and adrenals.

28
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,030
你得通知你的学校
You wanna put in notice with the college.

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,930
通知维罗妮卡和你的女儿
You should notify Veronica and your daughter

30
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,260
越快越好  因为治疗刻不容缓
as soon as possible as treatment will begin immediately.

31
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,500
还有多长时间
How long are we talking?

32
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,080
如果治疗的话  一年
With treatment, a year,

33
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,600
如果幸运的话  一年半
a year and a half, if you're lucky.

34
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,960
不治疗呢
And without?

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,970
也许能有六个月
Probably six months.

36
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,190
我很抱歉  理查德
I am so sorry, Richard.

37
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,750
{\an8}教授

38
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,060
操
Fuck.

39
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,100
{\an8}美国部分大学实行学季制  即一学年分为四学季
null1

40
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,100
让我们一起把这个学季变得更精彩
So let's make this a fantastic quarter.

41
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,500
拿到我们迫切需要的那点额外资助
We get that extra little bit of funding that we so desperately need.

42
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,730
还有问题吗
Uh, any questions?

43
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,670
操
Fuck.

44
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,390
什么  好了
What...? Uhm... Okay.

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,910
操
Fuck.

46
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,190
去他妈的耶稣
Jesus fucking Jesus.

47
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,540
耶稣  上帝  操
Jesus. God. Fuck.

48
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,590
去他妈的
Fucking bastard!

49
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,910
操  耶稣
Fuck! Jesus!

50
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,250
去他妈的
Fuck it, huh?

51
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,130
去他妈的上帝
Fucking God!

52
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,830
去你妈的
Fuck you!

53
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,150
去你妈的
Fuck you.

54
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,090
操
Fuck.

55
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,930
{\an8}第一章
我有事要说

56
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,770
接下来是要让无神论者祈祷了吗
Shall the atheist say grace then?

57
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,050
闭嘴  理查德
Shut up, Richard.

58
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,090
好的  亲爱的
Of course, my dear.

59
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,750
其实我也有事要说
I actually have something I wanna say.

60
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,080
来吧  孩子  你要说什么
Go ahead, kid. What do you got?

61
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,310
我想让你们知道  我是个同性恋
I wanted you to know that I'm gay.

62
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,600
你在说什么
What on Earth?

63
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,330
天哪
Jesus Christ.

64
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,290
奥丽维娅  我还以为你要说什么坏消息
Olivia, I thought it was something bad.

65
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,950
不  你不是  奥丽芙
No, you're not, Olive.

66
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,220
你说我不是是什么意思
What do you mean I'm not?

67
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
你不是同性恋  不是拉拉
You're not gay. I mean, you're not a lesbian.

68
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,850
我是
Yeah, I am.

69
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,470
我觉得我知道自己的性取向
Yeah. No, I think I'd know my own sexual preference.

70
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,870
这只是阶段性的
Uh, it's just a phase.

71
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,060
就我个人而言  我觉得这挺好的
I, for one, think it's fantastic.

72
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,120
不要惯着她
Don't placate her.

73
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,890
我没有惯着我的女儿
I'm not placating my daughter.

74
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,870
你怎么能这样否认我
How dare you deny me like this.

75
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,510
我没有否认你  亲爱的
I'm not denying you, sweetheart.

76
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,100
我只是不认同你做这样的事
I'm just denying your call for attention

77
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,130
来吸引注意力  仅此而已
or whatever else this is. That's all.

78
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,030
我了解你  奥丽芙  比你自己更了解你
I know you, Olive, better than you know yourself.

79
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,980
不  妈妈  你一点都不了解我
No, mother. You know no shit about me.

80
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,020
奥丽维娅  拜托你回来  奥丽维娅
Olivia, please come back, sweetheart. Olivia.

81
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,540
随她去吧
Let her go.

82
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,820
你教育孩子的方法
Your finesse of parenting...

83
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,060
一直都让我叹为观止
has always amazed me.

84
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,350
我也有事要说
I also have something I'd like to say.

85
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,880
洗耳恭听
I can't wait.

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,540
我出轨了
I'm having an affair.

87
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,670
我出轨了  我觉得应该让你知道
I'm having an affair and I thought you should know.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,770
你为什么觉得应该让我知道
And why did you think I should know?

89
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,420
因为是跟亨利
Because it's with Henry.

90
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,850
哪个亨利
Henry who?

91
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,710
亨利·莱特
Henry Wright.

92
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,900
亨利·莱特
Henry Wright?

93
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,870
我的上司
My boss?

94
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,890
别吧  维罗妮卡  这也恶心了
No, no, no, no. Veronica. That's real revolting.

95
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,960
你疯了吗  拜托
Are you out of your mind? Come on.

96
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,400
就算是搞外遇也要有点品位吧
At least have a little bit of taste in your infidelity.

97
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,890
选择权在你
It's up to you,

98
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,130
但如果是我  我会选救生员或水管工
but I'd fucked a pool boy myself or a plumber.

99
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,900
而不是跟一个没种的软蛋
Than had some fucking nutless sack.

100
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,680
我可以跟你保证不是软的
I assure you it's not empty.

101
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,580
什么
What?

102
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,880
亨利有幸比常人多一个睾丸
Henry has been blessed with a spare testicle.

103
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,110
亨利有幸比常人多一个睾丸
Henry was blessed with a spare testicle?

104
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,450
你确定那不是囊肿或者癌性肿瘤
Are you sure it's not a cyst or a cancerous growth?

105
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,370
你真的在乎吗
Do you even care?

106
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,350
关于他的第三个蛋
About his third nut?

107
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,610
不  我不在乎
No. No, I don't.

108
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,730
就我所知
As far as I'm concerned,

109
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,850
他的那些房产早就失去了投资价值
that real estate's lost its value long ago.

110
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,370
你真是个混蛋
You're such an ass.

111
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,720
我承认
Self-admitted.

112
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,210
为我们神圣的婚姻干杯
So let us drink to our holy matrimony.

113
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,550
你自己喝去吧
Drink by yourself.

114
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,120
这个主意更好
Much better idea.

115
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,620
你之前想跟我们说什么来着
Ugh. What was it you wanted to tell us?

116
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,850
我恐怕  把牛排煎过头了  就这事
I was, uh, afraid I overcooked the steaks. That's it.

117
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,420
真是个混蛋
Such an asshole.

118
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,160
但是她根本不是这个意思
No, but that's not what she's saying at all.

119
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,320
她为整个女权运动打下了基础
She's laying the groundwork for the whole feminist movement.

120
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,270
继续
Go on.

121
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,620
她的思想比同代人前卫一百多年
Like a hundred years in advance and...

122
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,870
怎么回事
What was that?

123
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,890
你不打算做点什么吗
Aren't you gonna do anything?

124
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,680
比如什么
Like what?

125
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,600
我也不知道  叫人来处理
I don't know. Call someone.

126
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,090
你是它朋友吗
Were you friends with it?

127
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,100
还是你认识它  知道它的名字
Did you know it personally, by, like, by name?

128
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,250
就是只鸟而已
It's a fucking bird.

129
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,180
我不知道该叫谁来
I don't know who to call.

130
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,110
-我能继续说吗  -不能
- Can I continue? - No, you may not.

131
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,920
是谁的手机  是你的手机吗
Oh, whose phone is it? Is that your phone?

132
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,130
靠
Shit.

133
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,610
在那儿呢  她的
There we go. Here she is.

134
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,580
抱歉
Sorry.

135
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,440
是我的  抱歉
Mine. Sorry.

136
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,200
我以为自己调成震动了  但是
Um, I thought it was on vibrate but it's...

137
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,220
不  不  没关系  接电话吧
No, no, no, please, take your call.

138
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,750
站起来接电话
Stand up and take your call.

139
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,030
请  不要害羞
Please. Don't be shy.

140
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,030
站起来  然后接电话
Stand up and take your call.

141
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,350
你好
Hello.

142
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,560
我一会给你回电话  因为我在上课
I'm gonna call you back actually because I'm in class.

143
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,320
不  我就在课堂上
No, as in I'm in class.

144
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,140
现在  我正站在课堂上
Right now. I'm standing up.

145
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,110
我知道这很奇怪  好了
I know it's weird. Okay.

146
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,300
再见  拜  拜
Goodbye. Bye. Bye.

147
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,840
非常好
Fascinating.

148
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,230
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,130
不要抱歉
Oh, don't be.

150
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,130
好了
Okay.

151
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,100
从现在开始
From here on out,

152
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,580
我们要采取非常不同的上课方式
we're gonna do things very, very differently.

153
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,230
所以  那些完全没兴趣
So for those of you who are not even remotely interested

154
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,650
坐在这里的人  请你们离开
in being here, please leave.

155
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,820
很简单  只要走出这扇门
Just simply walk out the door

156
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,310
你就自动得到一个C
and you'll receive an automatic C.

157
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,060
我已经没多少时间可以浪费了
I no longer have time to be wasted

158
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,740
我也不想浪费你们的
nor do I intend on wasting yours.

159
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,330
所以  那些得过C
So for those of you who receive grades of,

160
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,330
或更低成绩的人  就主动点
say, a C or worse, let's just be proactive.

161
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,790
收拾好东西  现在就赶紧走人
Pack up your shit. And vamos now.

162
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,750
很好  这就对了
Good. Here we go.

163
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,480
你们之中如果有人打算以后去学商科
If any of you have any intentions of studying business,

164
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,180
现在就给我滚出去
get the fuck out now.

165
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,570
我只说这一遍
I'm not gonna say it again.

166
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,540
如果你们低下头正好看到自己穿的是运动裤
If you look down and you happen to find yourself in sweatpants

167
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,280
或是任何有抽绳之类的裤子
or rather pants with the drawstring or something,

168
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,730
-慢走不送  -什么
- just please leave. - What?

169
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,730
最重要的一点  如果你们从未
Most important of all, if you've never read a book

170
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,090
出于内心的愉悦去阅读一本书
for our own internal pleasure...

171
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,940
那你们就不属于这里  出去
you don't belong here. Get out.

172
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,280
如果你们之中有人
If any of you find yourself

173
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,930
属于以上类别之一
falling into any of these categories,

174
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,660
我向你们保证  你们的成绩不会高于C
I assure you, you will not do better than a C.

175
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,280
这就对了
Here we go.

176
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,710
政府公务员和政客都走了
The government workers and the politicians included.

177
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,000
运动裤那段话不是开玩笑
The, uh, sweatpants comment is not a joke.

178
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,810
我生病了  我感冒了
I'm sick. I have a cold.

179
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,410
好了  现在  那些有兴趣
Right. Now, for those of you who are interested

180
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,280
向伟大的灵魂学习的人

181
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,410
那么请你们这学季读一本书
and there are today, you're in charge of reading one book

182
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,360
只读这一本

183
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,250
读完之后  你就站在讲台上
After doing so, you will then stand up here

184
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,130
自己来讲一堂课
and you will run a class of your own.

185
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:57,400
很好  只动嘴不动手的也走了
Excellent. There go the kings and queens of the water cooler,

186
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,880
未来的企业蛀虫
corporate whores of tomorrow.

187
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,700
C  还是算了吧
C. Maybe not.

188
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,290
然后你们就请站上讲台  告诉同学们
And then you will stand up here and you'll persuade your peers

189
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,460
这本书的重要性
of the work's importance.

190
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,280
做到这一点  你们就能得B
For that, you'll receive a B.

191
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,760
如果你教了我们新知识  就能得A
If you teach us something new, you receive an A.

192
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,880
还有什么问题吗
Any questions?

193
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,580
对了  还有一件事
Ah-ha. Yes. One more thing.

194
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,120
不要宣扬女权或是同性恋
No feminist or queer propaganda.

195
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,810
说真的  邋遢凌乱的女人们面对的困境
The plight of unkempt women is truly the last thing

196
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,250
是我现在最不想知道的东西
I would like to think about right now.

197
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,360
我认为你无权这么做
I don't think you can do that.

198
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,880
我就这么做了
I just did.

199
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,480
现在  我要在接下来的72小时里放飞自我
And now, I shall embark on an emotional...bender for 72 hours.

200
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,100
我多半会独自饮酒
Most likely, I'll be drinking alone

201
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,970
而我对此感觉良好
and I'm all right with that.

202
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,950
所以本节课就取消了
So as a result, class is cancelled.

203
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,690
我说完了
That's it.

204
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,860
下课
Class dismissed.

205
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,410
对了如果你们有人卖大麻
Oh, yeah, by the way, if any of you sell marijuana

206
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,010
或是认识卖大麻的人
or you know anyone who does,

207
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,280
请在办公时间来找我
would you please visit me during office hours?

208
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,990
谢了  拜
Thanks. Bye.

209
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,980
什么鬼
What the fuck?

210
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,140
{\an8}美国大学中工作一定年限的教师享有的带薪假期
null

211
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,140
下学季我想要个学术休假
I need to go on sabbatical next quarter.

212
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,970
不行  我没法给你批学术休假  这要一年
I would... No, I can't give you a sabbatical, it takes a year.

213
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,380
要花一年的时间才能批下来
A year to get that kind of thing done.

214
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,130
那你就得做点什么来加速批准了
You're gonna have to do something to speed it up.

215
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,130
不  我不行
No, I can't.

216
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,420
你要学术休假干什么
What do you want to go on a sabbatical for?

217
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,850
我想写出下一部伟大的美国长篇小说
I would like to write the next great American novel.

218
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,290
-是吗  -或者短篇小说
- Oh, yeah? - Or novela,

219
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,980
-取决于故事长短  -书是关于什么的
- depending on the length. - What's it about?

220
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,530
讲的是一个孤儿的故事
It's gonna be about an orphan

221
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,320
她养了一群大兔子或者小兔子
who raises rabbits or bunnies around there.

222
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,640
那书名是什么
And what's it called?

223
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,450
目前暂定的题目是《找到快乐的巴妮》
Right now, the tentative title is Bunny Fun Found

224
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,960
因为她的名字叫做巴妮  奇怪的是
because her name is Bunny and oddly enough,

225
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,550
-她很快乐  -满口屁话
- she was having fun... - You're full of shit.

226
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,270
满口屁话  你在骗我
You're full of shit. You're having me on.

227
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,120
-我得了癌症  彼得  -什么
- I have cancer, Peter. - What?

228
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,450
我得了癌症  而且情况并不乐观
I have cancer and it doesn't get look good.

229
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,690
我的老天  理查德
Jesus Christ, Richard.

230
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,660
我不想死在这里
I don't want to die here.

231
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,960
我不想像这样死在这里
I don't wanna die here like this.

232
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,540
拜托让我走吧  就让我独自死去
Please get me out. Just let me die alone.

233
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,050
让我安息
Let me die in peace.

234
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,330
理查德
Oh, Richard.

235
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,350
不要在桌上握我的手
No hands above the table.

236
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,390
好的
Okay.

237
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,970
是什么类型的癌症
What kind of cancer is it?

238
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,930
是肺癌
It's, uh, it's lung cancer.

239
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,130
你又不抽烟
You don't smoke.

240
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,360
我是不抽  但现在可以了
No. I can now.

241
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,880
听着  凡人皆有一死
Listen, this is what happens to everybody.

242
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,140
我们所有人都会面对死亡
It's what happens to all of us.

243
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,770
你也有可能也会得这种病
I mean, you could be ridden with the same damn thing.

244
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,630
你为什么要对我说这种话
Why would you say something like that to me, huh?

245
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,240
不是  我是在讲这个道理
No, no. I'm making a point.

246
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,770
抱歉  方式有误
I'm sorry. It came out wrong.

247
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,700
-对不起  对不起  -没事的
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - That's all right.

248
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,430
我真心讨厌这些娘娘腔的玻璃酒杯
I really hate these effeminate glasses.

249
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,160
我们要怎么办
What are we gonna do?

250
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,360
我会把我的药柜装满
I'm gonna fill my medicine cabinet.

251
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,930
然后在路上解决
And... I'm gonna ride this thing out.

252
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,260
等等  你不打算接受治疗吗
Wait, you're not gonna get treatments?

253
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,180
不
No.

254
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,200
-你欠我的  彼得  -是的
- You owe me, Peter. - Uh, yes.

255
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
是的  是的  当然
Yes. Yes, of course.

256
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,230
谢谢
Thank you.

257
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,810
现在你可以放开我的手了
You can let go of my hands now

258
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,780
然后我们或许可以干一杯
and then we can have a drink maybe.

259
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,410
-好的  -谢谢
- Yeah. - Thank you.

260
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,240
那么  敬时日无多
So to the months end.

261
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,740
祝你身体早日康复
To your health.

262
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,700
这时候就别开玩笑了吧
There's no need to be facetious.

263
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,410
我没想开玩笑
I didn't mean to be facetious.

264
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,850
也别张着大嘴到处讲
And don't go blabbering your little wet mouth about this.

265
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,940
-我不会说的  -这与任何人都无关
- No, no. - This is no one's business

266
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,420
-这是我自己的事  -当然
- but my own - Of course.

267
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,730
我觉得你的作品
I think your art is

268
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,710
精妙绝伦  匠心独具
brilliant, stunning,

269
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,920
是非常好的投资
and a wonderful investment.

270
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,550
事实上
In fact...

271
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,300
你能把整个学校都重设计一遍吗
could you do the whole campus?

272
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,840
-凭你的天赋  这当然  -佛罗里达学院
- Certainly with your talent... - To the College of Florida?

273
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,010
那是我的事
That's my responsibility.

274
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,410
不用你操心这个
You don't need to worry about that.

275
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,960
敬你最新的外遇
To your latest infidelity.

276
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,160
敬你的荣誉绿帽
And your honorable cuckolding.

277
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,120
那是什么
Ooh, what's that?

278
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,350
这是一颗白色的椭圆形药丸
It's a white oblong pill.

279
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,730
你从哪搞到的
Where did you get it?

280
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,370
我们是富裕的美国上层社会中年白人
We're well-to-do middle-aged WASPs.

281
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,940
我们什么药的处方都能搞到  亲爱的
We can get prescriptions for anything we want, darling.

282
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,030
好了
Okay.

283
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,840
如果你好好表现
If you behave yourself...

284
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,200
我就再给你一颗蓝色的三角形药丸
I'll give you a blue triangular one next.

285
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,040
我听说你可喜欢它们了
I heard you're quite fond of them.

286
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,030
说正事
Onto serious matters.

287
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,940
-说吧  -你心里清楚
- Go for it. - And you know at heart,

288
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,530
我根本不在乎你和亨利的事
I don't give a damn about you and Henry.

289
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,620
你怎么高兴怎么来
You do whatever you please.

290
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,850
但是你要意识到
But you have to realize

291
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,330
从现在开始  我也要活得自由
that from here on out, I'll be living just as freely.

292
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,720
我已经在我们悲剧的婚姻中
I've played a rather quiet role

293
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,670
沉默了好久了
in the tragedy that is our marriage.

294
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,680
而且
and...

295
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,740
说实话  我受够了
quite frankly, I'm done.

296
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,850
是时候让我们回归到
It's time that we lived a bit closer to the...

297
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,840
最初的本质上了
primal truth of it all.

298
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,740
所以从现在开始  我们想上谁就上谁
So from this point on, let us fuck who we wanna fuck.

299
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,280
想磕什么就磕什么
Let us ingest what we wanna ingest.

300
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,030
总之  只要我们高兴就好
And all in all, just do whatever the hell we damn well please.

301
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,610
说得好
Here, here.

302
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,130
只有一个要求
One request,

303
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,660
乐子与生活分开
that we do so discretely.

304
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,370
我们至少不要让这段破碎的婚姻
Let us at least attempt to keep the parental damage

305
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,850
对我们可爱的拉拉女儿造成太多伤害
to our sweet lesbian love child to a minimum.

306
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,860
完全同意
I wholeheartedly agree.

307
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,350
太好了  那问题就解决了
Wonderful. And the matter is settled.

308
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,490
理查德
Richard?

309
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,600
怎么了  亲爱的
Yes, dear?

310
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,470
我能问问你的家伙还好使吗
Dare I ask if your equipment still works?

311
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,550
我不知道
I don't know.

312
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,770
很遗憾  它已经很久没派上用场了
I mean, sadly, it's laid dormant for years.

313
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,230
即便不好使  再开一种药就行了
But if it doesn't, it's just one more prescription to fill.

314
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,300
这杯敬  我们的新生
Here's to, uh, our new lives.

315
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,470
还有你新获的自由
And your new freedoms.

316
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,490
现在把小蓝片给我吧  我已经表现得很好了
Now, hand over a blue one I've behaved myself admirably.

317
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,130
他就像是那种
He was like this, um...

318
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,750
爱上自己表妹的17世纪诗人
17th century poet who fell in love with his cousin and...

319
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,770
-爱上自己的表妹  -该死
- ...fell in love with his cousin? - Oh, shit.

320
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,230
你真是个混蛋
You're such an asshole.

321
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,050
-怎么了  -我父母在家
- What? - My parents are home.

322
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,250
没关系
Hey. It's okay.

323
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,060
你能保证不评判我吗
Can you promise not to judge me?

324
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,990
不用担心  真的
Don't worry, seriously.

325
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,520
摔坏了
It's broken.

326
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,960
彻底坏掉了
I mean, the whole thing is broken.

327
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,020
奥丽维娅  看  亲爱的
Oh, Olivia. Look, dear.

328
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,850
-是奥丽维娅和小伙伴  -怎么了
- It's Olivia and company. - What's going on?

329
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,910
你妈妈把台灯打坏了
Uh, your mom broke the lamp.

330
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,560
你们没事吧
Are you all right?

331
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,630
没事  亲爱的  当然了  怎么会有事
Yes, darling. Of course, why wouldn't we be?

332
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,560
因为你们看上去像是喝多了或是嗑药了
Because you seem like you're drunk or on drugs.

333
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,990
无可否认  我们两者皆有
Admittedly, we are on a bit of both.

334
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,880
但别让这事影响了你的决定
But don't let that influence your decisions.

335
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,180
别听他的
Oh, don't listen to him.

336
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,670
都是正规处方药
They're just prescriptions.

337
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,740
我是维罗妮卡  奥利维娅的妈妈
I'm Veronica, Olivia's mother.

338
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,850
你好  我是泰勒
Hi, I'm Taylor.

339
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,230
很高兴认识你
Oh, nice to meet you...

340
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,640
不好意思
Excuse me.

341
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,280
小心  亲爱的  别用力过度
Careful, dear. Let's not exert yourself.

342
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,250
所以这位...她就是...
So is this... is she...

343
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,630
泰勒就是泰勒  妈妈
Taylor is Taylor, mother.

344
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,290
当然  当然  那是一定的
Yes, yes, of course, you are.

345
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,740
对了  我是理查德
And by the way, I'm Richard.

346
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,000
-你要喝一杯吗  -对  来喝点
- Would you like a drink? - Yes, please, come.

347
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,360
-跟我们一起喝一杯  -不  等等  不
- Join us for a drink. - No, hang on. No.

348
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,620
你们太吓人了  我们要走了
You're being very creepy. We're going.

349
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,930
-吓人  -是的
- Creepy? - Yes.

350
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,730
我们只是找点乐子
We're just having fun.

351
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,250
走吧
Come on.

352
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,800
那个  很高兴认识你们
Hey, well, it was very nice meeting you.

353
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,140
-再见  -很高兴认识你
- Bye. - Nice to meet you.

354
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,270
还算愉快
That was pleasant.

355
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,650
你觉得刚才我们表现得怎么样
So how do you think that went?

356
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,360
从一到十打分的话
On a scale of one to ten,

357
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,920
我打四分
I'd say a four.

358
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,770
同意
Agreed.

359
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,140
我只对自己稍微有点失望
I'm only mildly disappointed in myself.

360
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,440
我觉得很丢人  是的
I feel ashamed. Yeah.

361
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,590
我们之间是怎么回事  理查德
What happened to us, Richard?

362
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,880
我们之间是怎么回事
What happened to us?

363
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,270
生活
Life.

364
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,010
即便我能回到过去
You know, if I could go back in time,

365
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,090
我也还是不知道该弥补什么
I don't even know what it is I'm supposed to fix.

366
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,210
我倒是能轻易想到许多事情
Oh, I could readily think of many things.

367
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,180
我没问你
I didn't ask you.

368
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,730
是的
True.

369
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,830
你是要把所有结婚礼物都打碎吗
You're gonna break all our wedding presents.

370
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,390
你有没有注意到它们都是空心的
Did you ever notice that they're all hollow?

371
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
这话什么意思
Ah, what does that mean?

372
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,760
不重要了
It doesn't matter.

373
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,960
理查德
Richard?

374
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,020
怎么了  亲爱的
Yes, dear?

375
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,570
谢谢你帮我
Thank you for helping me.

376
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,720
不客气
Of course.

377
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,120
给你梳头发一直都是
Holding your hair back has always been

378
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,830
我此生最大的荣幸之一
one of my life's great honors.

379
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,610
我认真的
I'm serious.

380
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,090
我也是
In ways, so am I.

381
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,290
你觉得奥利维娅恨我吗
Do you think Olivia hates me?

382
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,380
是的
Yes.

383
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,410
但她也该恨
But she's supposed to.

384
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,560
我不是个坏人
I'm not a bad person.

385
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,380
我知道你不是  维罗妮卡
I know you're not, Veronica.

386
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,830
没人说过你是
No one ever said you were.

387
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,460
{\an8}第二章
搞  好好搞

388
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,820
你们还算是
Well, you are a...

389
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,960
一群比较讨人喜欢的孩子
relatively attractive group of kids.

390
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,290
我看到了几个小下巴
I mean, I see a few weak chins here and there.

391
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,120
不过  我猜很可能是因为
But, uh, I think that's probably just due to

392
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,080
一些优秀的新英格兰式家庭教育
some fine New England breeding. Hmm?

393
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,160
漂亮的母亲  富有的父亲
Beautiful mother, rich father,

394
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,750
寒冷的冬季  之类的
cold winter, that kind of thing.

395
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,660
你抽烟吗
Do you smoke?

396
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,360
不抽
No.

397
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,160
你看起来像会抽烟
You look like you do.

398
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,680
我抽  布朗先生
I do, Mr. Brown.

399
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,410
能给我来一根吗
Would you mind if I have one?

400
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,150
当然可以
No, not at all.

401
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,750
所以...
So, um...

402
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,840
咱们轮流自我介绍吧
let's go through and introduce ourselves.

403
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,860
有主动的吗
Any volunteers?

404
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,240
那我先来  我叫理查德
I'll go first. My name is Richard.

405
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,730
我是你们的教授  点上
I'm your professor. Go ahead.

406
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,880
这也太他妈呛人了
That was fucking wretched.

407
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,370
天啊
Jesus.

408
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,740
好吧
Okay.

409
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,720
下一个谁来
Who's next?

410
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,450
就你吧
How about you?

411
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,750
-我  -对  你
- Me? - Yeah, you,

412
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,210
带手机的姑娘
girl with the phone.

413
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,440
你是谁
Who are you,

414
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,230
我们为什么要认识你
why should we know you,

415
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,110
你以后想做什么
what do you want to do with your life?

416
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,470
好的
Okay.

417
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,520
我叫克莱尔
I'm Claire.

418
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,950
我来自纽约上州
I'm from Upstate New York.

419
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,610
你们为什么要认识我
Why you should know me?

420
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,300
我也不知道
I don't know.

421
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,520
是的  我不知道
Yeah. I don't know.

422
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,350
我猜大概是因为我叔叔是学校校长
I guess because my uncle is the president of the school.

423
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,350
亨利·莱特是你叔叔
Henry Wright is your uncle?

424
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,310
-是的  -我最讨厌那个混蛋了
- Yes. - I can't stand the fuck.

425
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,440
我也不太喜欢他
I don't really like him either.

426
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,650
那太好了
That's very good to hear.

427
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,240
他就像那种桃子冰淇淋一样
I mean, he's so peach melba.

428
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,730
又腻又...
Just slimy and...

429
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,830
我有个主意
I've got an idea.

430
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,600
不如我们先把自我介绍暂停一下
How about we put a little pause to this shit

431
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,040
找个酒吧
and we go down to the bar,

432
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,140
在那里继续怎么样
and we can run over it there.

433
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,310
我的生父其实是在波士顿一个堆肥大会上
My biological father actually met my mothers

434
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,930
认识我妈妈的
at a monthly compost meeting in Boston.

435
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,360
他是一个社会人类学家...
He's this social anthropologist over at a...

436
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,820
好了  萝丝
Okay. Rose,

437
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,230
去给我们每人再多拿两杯酒  好吗
go and grab two more pitchers for everybody, would you?

438
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,650
你为什么不直接记账呢
Why don't you just put them in your tab?

439
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,150
那就没意义了
No, that's not the point.

440
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,590
我想要你去拿
See, I want you to go and get them.

441
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,960
而且我想要你现在就去拿  好吗
And I want you go and get them now, please?

442
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,040
我能再拿点鹰嘴豆泥吗
Can I get some hummus?

443
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,160
当然  拿吧
Yeah, get some hummus.

444
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,410
谢谢
Thank you.

445
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,330
我给你们所有人一个建议
Let me give you all a piece of advice.

446
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,140
一定要离那种有意怀孕的人远点儿
Steer very clear of anyone who has even the faintest,

447
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,450
有一丁点想法都不行
slightest whip of intentional conception.

448
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,240
我爸妈就是有意要的我
I was conceived intentionally.

449
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,020
告诉我你的名字
Well, I need to know your name.

450
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,450
对了  希望你们爸妈都告诉你们了
By the way, I hope your parents all told you

451
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,620
你们最终都他妈会死
that you fucking die at the end.

452
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,470
你会死  你会死
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

453
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,970
你也会死  有一天
You're gonna die. One day,

454
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,720
我们幸福的小萝丝也会死
even our blessed little Rose will die.

455
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,670
所以  我一直在想
So, what I'm wondering is, why the fuck

456
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,870
为什么我们要浑浑噩噩地度过这一生
do we sort of float through this weird thing

457
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,200
却不曾真正地活着
called life without living?

458
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,800
懂吗  生活
You know, live.

459
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,210
不要生存  不要只是生存
Don't exist. Don't simply exist.

460
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,680
那也太他妈无趣了  而是真正的生活
That's boring as fuck. Live.

461
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,500
多趟几趟浑水  多搞砸些事儿
You know. Stir some shit up. Fuck some shit up.

462
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,720
好好搞
Fuck it right.

463
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,480
我更关心的是
What I wanna focus on

464
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,420
如何丰富我们的生活
is enriching our lives.

465
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,970
然后从中提取某种
And try to extract some sort of wisdom

466
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,630
能值得铭记一生的智慧
that we can carry with us.

467
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,370
而不是妈咪和爸比的陈词滥调
You know, something other than mommy and daddy's baggage.

468
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,370
上帝保佑你  亲爱的
Ah, bless you, dear.

469
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,600
我想对你眨眼  但是我一直都学不会
You know, I'd wink at you but I never learned how.

470
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,530
就是想告诉你一声
So I just thought you should know it.

471
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,890
有人还想要别的吗
Anybody want anything else?

472
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,290
我能来杯威士忌吗
Yeah, could I get a whiskey?

473
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,560
可以
Oh, that's fine.

474
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,090
她对我眨眼了

好吧  再给我倒一杯
Okay. Pour me another one of those

633
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,930

634
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,620
-当然  -真的不确定
- Of course. - ...really not sure how much

635
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,800

So, like, there's no... I mean, couldn't...

638
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,830
我们不需要亲亲的  对吧
we don't have to kiss, right?

639
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,460
-没有亲亲  -没有
- There's no kissing. - No.

640
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,440
是因为我们都是男的吗
Is it like 'cause we're boys?

641
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,980
-对  -好吧
- Yeah. - Oh, okay.

642
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,260
我们齐聚在这里  共同见证
And so we're gathered to dedicate...

643
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:02,410
当代最杰出的艺术家之一的作品
the work of one of the finest contemporary artists of today,

644
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,540
一位我有幸称之为朋友的人
and someone that I am honored to call a dear friend,

645
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:11,220
-维罗妮卡·辛克莱·布朗夫人  -做得好

646
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,690

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,530
挺美的
It's, uh, wonderful.

648
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,900
很好
Oh, that's great.

649
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,270
请问那是什么
May I ask what is it?

650
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,080
就是个大鸡巴
It's a giant schmeckle.

651
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,020

你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

657
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,560
妈妈不允许我去州立学校
Um, mom says I'm not allowed to go to state schools.

658
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,850
你妈妈没权力不允许你做任何事
Your mom is not allowed to say you're not allowed.

659
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,820
你最好还是不要去
It's probably best if you don't.

660
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,880
别听他的  听我的
Don't listen to him. Listen to me.

661
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,650

00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,940
那个  是  挺棒的
The... uh, it was... yeah, it was good.

665
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,620
挺好的
It's all right, yeah.

666
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,020
要一起喝杯酒庆祝一下吗
So, shall we have a celebratory drink?

667
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,040
我很乐意  但亨利要带我去参加
I'd love to, but Henry has me going out to dinner

668
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,930
赞助商的酒宴
with the benefactors.

669
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,040
是一个康涅狄格州的老牌家族
It's an old money from Connecticut.

670
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,380
回家见
I'll see you two at home.

671
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,930
再见  亲爱的  谢谢  彼得
Bye, sweetie. Thanks, Peter.

672
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,010
你确定不要
Are you sure you don't want

673
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,080
来点伏特加或是布朗尼吗
a little splash of vodka or brownie?

674
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,590
你和妈妈为什么还在一起
Why are you and mom still together?

675
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,260
是的
Yeah.

676
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,560
真是个奇怪的问题
That's a rather odd question.

677
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,910
并不是
No, it's not.

678
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,510
我想你是对的  我们
And I guess you're right, we... um...

679
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,700
我想等你长大
I think as you get older,

680
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:42,900
你就会发现自己需要
you, um, find yourself needing someone

681
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,980
能让自己对生活负责的人
to hold accountable for life

682
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,830
而不是到头来发现只是自己的想象
not turning out exactly as you'd imagined it.

683
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,840
天哪  爸
Jesus, dad.

684
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,010
我知道
I know.

685
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,770
但听我说  不是所有感情都是这样
But listen to me, not every relationship has to be that.

686
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,860
我是说  话虽如此  大多数都是这样
I mean, having said that, most are.

687
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,470
好吧
Okay.

688
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,630
换个轻松点的话题  最近和泰勒怎么样
On that happy note. How's it going with Taylor?

689
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,000
进展很顺利
It's going really well.

690
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,470

Yeah? Good, that's good.

691
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,860
非常好
That's very good.

692
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,600
你爱上她了吗
Are you in love?

693
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,180
是的
Yeah. I am.

694
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,890
可以
No shit.

695
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,900
我真为你高兴  亲爱的
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you, sweetheart.

696
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,180
我真开心  真为你开心
I'm so happy. I'm so happy for you.

697
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,660
谢谢
Thanks.

698
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,050
你要确保她明白你的价值
You make sure she understands your worth.

699
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,270
-我知道  她明白  -她最好明白
- I know. She does. - She better.

700
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,660
她妈的最好明白
She damn well better.

701
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,070
你女儿坠入爱河了
Your daughter is in love.

702
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,690
你有让她小心一点吗
Did you tell her to be careful?

703
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,700
没有
No.

704
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,410
我告诉她要享受
Told her to enjoy herself.

705
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,020
{\an8}第三章
我真的要死了

706
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,680
实现自己的命运是一个人唯一的义务
To realize one's destiny is a person's only obligation.

707
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,810
于是他开始倾听沙漠
And so, he begins listening to the desert,

708
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,500
然后  发现这个世界的灵魂
and, discovering the soul of the world,

709
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,370
这不可避免地把我们带向
which then inevitably, leads us to...

710
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,750
好了  停
All right, stop.

711
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,800
你得了个B
You get a B.

712
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,510
-但我还没说完  -坐下
- But I'm not finished. - Take a seat.

713
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,580
我觉得挺不错的
I thought it was great.

714
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,000
我想问你们一个问题
Let me ask you a question.

715
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,070

Are you guys getting anything out of this shit?

716
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,070
有
Yeah.

717
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,200
很好  因为我不得不说  我也有收获
Good. Because I have to say, I am as well.

718
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,870
你们都是群可靠的年轻人
I mean, you're all rather a solid group of young adults,

719
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,370
我很享受你们的陪伴
and I enjoy your company.

720
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,280
是的  没错  我觉得我们都很成熟
Yeah. Yeah, I'd say we're all pretty mature.

721
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:11,940
成熟这个词不过是
Well, maturity is really just another word for...

722
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,810
你咽下了多少痛苦的另一种说法
how much misery you'd swallow.

723
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,950
没错  正是如此
Yeah, totally.

724
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,290
我说的痛苦是别人给你带来的  萝丝
I'm talking about the piss and shit of others, Rose,

725
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,720
不是你自己的
not your own.

726
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,710
介意我抽根大麻烟吗
Do you mind if I smoke a joint?

727
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,340
谢谢
Thanks.

我很愿意帮忙  接手他的课
I'm more than happy to help, uh, pick up his classes,

729
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,570
如果这样能帮上忙的话
if that helps at all.

730
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,010
你这是在逗我吗
You got to be kidding me.

731
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,880
他是在抽大麻烟吗
Is he smoking a marijuana cigarette?

732
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,590
也许他只是试着
Look, maybe he's just trying to be...

733
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,580
真他妈难以置信
Fucking unbelievable.

734
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,560
理查德啊
Oh, Richard.

735
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,760
你为什么戴着墨镜
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

736
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,650
我得了癌症  我本就该在不常见的场合
I have cancer, I'm supposed to wear sunglasses

737
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,200
戴着墨镜
in unusual places.

738
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,120
行吧
Yeah.

739
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,450
不好意思  能再给我们来两杯吗

我不想跟你走
I don't wanna go with you.

744
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,860

Peter, where are we going?

745
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,600
我要带你去互助小组
I'm taking you to support group.

746
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,370
什么互助小组
A support group for what?

747
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,710
-癌症  -天哪
- Cancer. - Oh, Jesus.

748
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,300
你要想让我帮你搞定学术休假的事情
Want me to help you with your sabbatical,

749
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,740
那就为了我去  这件事对我来说可不容易
then do this for me. This is not easy for me,

750
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,110
说实话  这件事真的很艰难
it's actually, it's quite hard.

751
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,570
我理解  但是  你要知道  是我要死
I understand that, but, you know, it's my death.

752
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,600
是啊
Yeah.

753
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,860
这是个什么玩意儿
What the fuck is this?

754
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,240
这辆车是芭芭拉的
Well, it's, it's Barbara's.

755
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,680
我才不要进去
I'm not getting in.

756
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,180
闭嘴  上车
Shut up, and get in the damn car.

757
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,390
其实这车开起来挺舒服的
It actually drives quite nice.

758
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,510
开下车门
Door.

759
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,310
-好了  -很好
- Here you go. - Well done.

760
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,610
都结婚20年了  我以为她会
After 20 years of marriage, I thought she'd, you know,

761
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,360
陪我到最后一刻
stick around until I died.

762
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,810
至少  我希望她能这样
At least, I hoped she would.

763
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,310
但我猜这样真的没意义吧
But, I guess, it was really no point,

764
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,580
我猜对她来说
you know, I guess it makes more sense for her

765
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,100
向前看才是最合理的
to move on now.

766
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,690
但尽管如此  我  我
But despite all that, I'm-I'm...

00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,500
害怕

00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:42,980
我看起来病怏怏的吗
Do I look sick to you?

933
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,600
你现在躺在病床上  理查德
You're in a hospital bed, Richard.

934
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,890
你不说说昨晚去哪了吗
You wanna say where you were last night?

935
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,070
不是很想
Not really.

936
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,690
我们说好了的  为了奥丽维娅
We had a deal for Olivia.

对不起
I'm sorry.

939
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,870
你还好吗
Are you okay?

940
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,700
还好  只是背疼
Yeah. It's just my back.

941
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,780
理查德
Richard?

942
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,790

943
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,070
抱歉  我没听见你回复

944
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,890
我是卡罗尔  亨利的秘书
Uh, it's Carol, Henry's secretary.

945
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:55,030
理查德  亨利想和你谈谈
Uh, Richard, Henry would like to have a word with you.

946
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,580
-什么时候  -现在
- When? - Now.

947
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,530
告诉他我很忙
Tell him I'm busy.

948
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,810
他说这件事相当紧急
He says the matter is rather urgent.

949
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:04,450
告诉他我忙一件很紧急的事
Tell him I'm urgently busy.

950
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,440
理查德
Richard.

951
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:08,850
请说
Yes?

952
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,190
他准备好见你了
He's ready to see you now.

953
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,520
告诉我  理查德  你喜欢鱼吗
Tell me, Richard, do you like fish?

954
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,270
不  我有时会吃鱼
No. I mean to eat sometimes,

955
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,520
但除此之外  不  我不喜欢
but outside of that, no. No, I don't.

956
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:44,660
我相信人类可以从鱼身上学到很多
I believe men could learn a lot from fish.

957
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,890
这是我听过最愚蠢的话了
That's the most asinine thing I've ever heard.

958
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,100
我们不如直接进入正题吧
Why don't we just cut to the chase?

959
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,450
好吧
All right.

960
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,030
我们需要谈一些针对你的指控
We need to talk about certain allegations

961
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,870
这些指控已经引起了我的关注
that have come to my attention,

962
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,260
其中一些还很严重
some of which are serious.

963
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,990
你可闭嘴吧
Don't even start.

964
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,920
你说什么
Excuse me?

965
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,040
我知道你听到了我的话
I know you heard what I said.

966
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,520
你这么问是为了做做样子
You're simply saying that for effect.

967
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,130
你想让我重复自己的话  我不会重复
You want me to repeat myself, I won't.

968
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,630
我可是这所大学的校长
I am chancellor of this university.

969
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,620
我他妈一点都不在乎
I couldn't give a fucking rat's balls

970
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,910
你他妈是谁  我拥有终身教职
who the fuck you are. I have tenure,

971
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:19,500
此外
and furthermore,

972
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,060
你根本没有资格或是权力对我指手划脚
you're in no position of power when it comes to the two of us.

973
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,590
你背着妻子在外面偷情  亨利
You're cheating on your wife, Henry.

974
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:29,140
你出轨了  还不是一般的出轨
You're having an affair, and not just any affair,

975
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,760
而是和一位忠心耿耿的教职工的妻子
but one with a wife of a devoted faculty member,

976
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,720
具体地说
specifically

977
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,010
我的妻子
mine.

978
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,040
不止如此  你还从不断减少的预算中
Not only that. But you've allocated funds

979
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,290
拨出资金来建造花岗岩大鸡巴
from a dwindling budget for granite erections

980
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:47,970
搞得满校园都不堪入目
that you just littered throughout this entire campus.

981
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,710
而奇怪的是  设计这些东西的
And oddly enough, they come from the woman

982
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,970
正是你背地里偷情的对象
that you're bird dogging on the side.

983
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,760
可否提醒我一下
Can you remind me

984
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,360
维罗妮卡的作品每件卖出了多少钱
how much does one of Veronica's works go for?

985
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,240
校长  你就像只奔跑的雄鹿一样
Chancellor, I have mounted you

986
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,740
被我骑在身下
like a running stag,

987
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,330
而且我已经开搞你了
and I am pumping away at you,

988
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:09,430
就像个野蛮人
like a savage,

989
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,230
你明白的
and you know it.

990
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:15,510
那么现在
Now,

991
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,990
我就默认我的学术休假申请
I'm gonna take it that my request for sabbatical

992
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,600
已经被批准了
has been accepted.

993
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:54,720
{\an8}第四章
真的开始发作了

994
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,170
别摆出这么热衷的样子
Don't look so enthusiastic.

995
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,700
为什么
Why would I?

996
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,740
一方面  酒席菜品是别家承办的
Well, for one, it's gonna be catered.

997
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,670
而且芭芭拉只会讲她去过多少地方旅游
All Barbara ever talks about is how well traveled she is.

998
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,330
她还能说什么
Well, what else would she talk about?

999
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,650
谢谢你  亲爱的
Thank you, dear.

1000
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,020
西班牙伊维萨岛的空气
The air in Ibiza,

1001
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,670
真的无与伦比
there's really nothing like it.

1002
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,810
光是想想  我就激动到视线模糊
I'm getting misty, just thinking about it.

1003
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:22,730
彼得  让我们的经理人
Peter, put our agent

1004
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,940
跟他们保持联系  好吗
in touch with them, all right?

1005
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,980
好的  当然  我很愿意效劳
Yes, of course, yes, I'd be happy to.

1006
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,820
理查德
Richard?

1007
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,410
理查德  你怎么了
Richard, what's the matter?

1008
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,260
亲爱的  随他去吧
Uh, darling, let him be.

1009
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,750
总之  话说回来  伊维萨岛
Anyway, as I was saying, Ibiza...

1010
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,970
你还好吗
Are you all right?

1011
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,870
-你不会后悔的  -我岂止还好
- You won't regret it. - I'm more than all right.

1012
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,580
-不可能后悔  -我状态完美
- You can't. - I'm perfect.

1013
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:45,040
除非你疯了才会后悔
I mean, unless you're mad.

1014
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,210
我说得对吧  彼得
Am I right or what, Peter?

1015
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,270
你说得对  亲爱的  你都对
Oh, you're right, darling, you're right.

1016
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,370
还有哪位的鱼肉里有刺吗
Does anybody else have bones in the fish?

1017
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,740
我们有值得庆祝的事了
We have something to celebrate.

1018
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,330
什么事  你也得癌症了吗
What's that? You got cancer, too?

1019
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,640
不  我没有  你为什么总是说这个
No. I do not. Why do you keep saying that?

1020
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,550
我的
Uh, my...

1021
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,210
我的囊肿倒是挺疼的
Uh, I... my cyst is rather sore.

1022
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,250
你嗓子里长了东西吗
Something in your throat?

1023
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,720
我觉得应该去检查一下
I think I should get it screened.

1024
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,270
-或许吧  -好了  好
- Maybe. - Yeah. Yeah.

1025
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:09,100
-摩洛哥  -没错
- Morocco. - Yeah.

1026
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,210
理查德  不  别这样  不行
Uh, Richard, uh, no, no, no,

1027
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,850
那样只会助长她的威风
that'll only encourage her.

1028
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,740
我们发现  每次去的时候
...We've noticed that it's allowed us

1029
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:20,580
它都会让我们发现关于我们自身的新东西
every time we've been to discover something new about ourselves.

1030
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,900
你  我的朋友  已被奖励学术休假
You, my friend, have been awarded a sabbatical.

1031
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:27,560
谢谢
Thank you.

1032
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,880
亨利·莱特上周刚签了文件批准
Henry Wright signed the paperwork, only last week.

1033
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,680
-抱歉失陪  -瞧  我跟你说过
- Excuse me. - See, I told you.

1034
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,370
你们两个在做什么
What are you two doing?

1035
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,530
我们在谈工作  仅此而已
Uh we're discussing work. That's all.

1036
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,570
彼得  今天是我生日
Peter, it's my birthday,

1037
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,970
你们下次再谈  来加入我们
save it for another time, and come mingle.

1038
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:46,010
-好  -还有  别关门
- All right. - And don't close these doors.

1039
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:47,280
好的  亲爱的
No, darling.

1040
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,620
总之  彼得吓坏了
Anyway, Peter was petrified...

1041
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:53,370
我们到底为什么要结婚
Why the hell did we ever get married?

1042
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:05,500
你还好吗
You okay?

1043
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,770
还好  我没事  亲爱的
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, babe.

1044
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,050
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1045
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,900
嗯
Yeah.

1046
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,920
是啊  我会没事的
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

1047
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,400
我们最初爱上的人
The person one loves at first

1048
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,740
并不会是到头来爱着的那个
is not the person one loves at last.

1049
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,540
爱不是最后的目标
Love is not an end,

1050
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:34,400
而是一个过程  人类在这个过程中尝试着
it's a process through, which one person attempts

1051
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,600
了解彼此
to know another.

1052
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,280
没了
That's it.

1053
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,790
一个词概括
And in a word?

1054
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:45,750
两个词概括  谜之简单
In two words, deceptively simple.

1055
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,360
讲得非常好
Beautifully, beautifully executed.

1056
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,810
用一些能点醒我们的东西
And it's a really nice way to

1057
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,510
来结束这门课
end the class with a little,

1058
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,110
真是再好不过了
kick in the ass.

1059
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,400
所以  你拿了A
So, you get an A.

1060
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,980
-谢谢你  -不用谢
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1061
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,780
我估计其他人都在等着我
And I suppose the rest of you are waiting

1062
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:09,050
吐出几句深刻的智慧之言
for me to vomit out some profound words of wisdom.

1063
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,460
差不多
Yeah, kind of.

1064
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:13,290
还以为你们不会问了呢
Oh, thought you'd never ask.

1065
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,480
来拉我一把
Come here, give me a hand.

1066
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,630
谢了
Thanks.

1067
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:20,590
好
Okay.

1068
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,470
听着
Listen...

1069
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,240
这个世界需要你们这样的人
The world needs people like you.

1070
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,030
说真的  这世界渴求你们这种人才
The world is literally dying for your kind.

1071
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,940
拥抱你们的责任  做到亲力亲为
Embrace that responsibility, and you run with it.

1072
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,000
出去挣一份相配的报酬  回馈这个世界
Get out there, earn your keep. Give back.

1073
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,740
这不会容易  从来都没有容易事
It's not gonna be easy. Never gonna be easy.

1074
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,440
很多时候  你们都会是孤身一人
For much of it, you'll stand alone

1075
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,200
但你们一定要坚守立场
but you've got to stand strong.

1076
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,620
真的  我恳求你们
You know, I beg you

1077
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,400
永远不要甘于平庸
to not give into mediocrity,

1078
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,070
别像另外那百分之98的人一样
like the other 98 percent of the world.

1079
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,140
因为那样的话  你们等于是对自己
Because you would be doing yourselves,

1080
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,940
也是对这世界  帮了个大倒忙
and the world, a greatest disservice.

1081
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,770
你们都太聪明
You're all too smart.

而且你们这辈子只能活一次

01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,150
嗯  我觉得是吧  没错

这里其他能坐的位置还有很多

1112
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,520
好吧
Yes.

没有
No.

1117

但我很喜欢这里的灯光
But I enjoy the lighting.

1118

1119
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:15,870
但没关系
But that's all right.

1120
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,540
圣母保佑  帮帮我的朋友
Please mother of God, help my friend...

1121
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,370
恐怕要开始发作了
Afraid it's starting to kick in.

1122
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,840
痛吗
Does it hurt?

1123
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,820

我回首过往
I mean, uh, I look back on everything,

1129
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,880
一切都变得合理了
and it all somehow makes so much sense.

1130
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:55,160
就好像  也不会有其他的结局
It's as though, uh, it couldn't be any other way.

1131
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,320
我们的灵魂为何如此残破
Why's our soul broken?

1132
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:05,740
荒诞
Absurd.

1133
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,540
但
Yet...

1134
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,210
却又是完美的
It's perfect.

1135
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,440
当你仔细审视它  它又是如此完美
And it's also perfect when you look at it.

-你明白我的意思吗  -明白
- You know what I mean? - Yeah.

1137
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,690

1138
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,360
很难说再见
It's gonna be hard to say goodbye.

1139
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,950
理查德  我会想你的

1157
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,280
这种感觉竟如此自然
Isn't it strange how natural this feels?

1158
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,120
-是啊  -两个男人
- Yeah. - Two men,

1159
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,430
在教堂里热情地互相拥抱
holding one another, passionately, in a church.

Young lady with the wine,

1234
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:42,810
不介意的话可以站在我旁边不要离开吗
would you mind just standing right by my side, and never leave?

1235
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:44,890
因为我有很多话要说
Because I have much to say

1236
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,080
-还有很多杯酒要敬  -我的上帝
- and many to toast. - Oh, my God.

1237
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,980
那些还不认识我的人  我叫理查德·布朗
Those of you who do not know, my name is Richard Brown.

1238
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:53,610
英文教授
Professor of English.

1239
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,280
为我干杯
Cheers to me.

1240
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,380
干杯
Cheers.

1241
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:59,820
-干杯  -敬理查德
- Cheers. - To Richard.

1242
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:05,310
亨利·莱特  我代表在座的每个人
Henry Wright, on behalf of every one of us here,

1243
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,710
为这强迫前来的美好夜晚
let me, please, express our gratitude,

1244
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,270
-向你表示感谢  -抱歉
- for this finely forced evening. - I'm sorry.

1245
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,650
你对学生
The commitment that you have shown

1246
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:17,300
教职工
to the students, faculty,

1247
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:20,180
甚至教职工的妻子  所表现出的承诺
even the wives of the faculty...

1248
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,260
令人印象深刻
...is very, very impressive.

1249
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,180
你已经超越了自己
You've outdone yourself.

1250
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,810
行胜于言
And it shows.

1251
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:32,980
就我而言  三个蛋
As far as I'm concerned, three balls...

1252
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,530
-值得三次干杯  -不要
- deserves three cheers. - No.

1253
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,970
好了  理查德  差不多得了
All right, Richard, I think that's enough.

1254
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:41,470
亨利  我说话的时候不要打断我
Henry, do not interrupt me while I'm talking.

1255
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,350
尤其是在这么多人面前
Particularly in front of so many people.

1256
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:45,810
-你明白吗  -不  我不明白
- Do you understand? - No, I don't understand.

1257
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:47,600
-没错  -没人能有三个睾丸
- Yeah. - Nobody has three testicles.

1258
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,870
敬彼得·马修
To Peter Matthew.

1259
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,790
都别说了
Gotta shut up.

1260
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,500
你真是有一颗金子般的心
Your heart is truly one of gold.

1261
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,220
-没错  -这所大学非常荣幸
- It is. - And this college is...

1262
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,610
-能拥有你这样的人  -是的
- very lucky to have you. - That's true.

1263
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:01,910
当然  还要感谢你的辛苦工作
Of course, thank you for your hard work.

1264
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,760
但最重要的是
But most important,

1265
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:07,040
谢谢你这样一位真诚的朋友
thank you for being a true friend.

1266
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,000
-敬彼得  干杯  -干杯
- To Peter, cheers. - Cheers.

1267
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,650
除此之外  我感觉我还欠你们几句离别赠言
Also there are some parting words that I feel like I owe.

1268
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,070
因为这将是我最后一次见到你们
Because this will be the last time that I ever see any of you.

1269
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,910
不仅是因为我被奖励了学术休假
For not only have I been awarded a sabbatical,

1270
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,500
好怪异  彼得
This is strange, Peter.

1271
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,330
我要死了
...I'm gonna die.

1272
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:36,670
没错
Yeah...

1273
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,550
我要死了
I'm gonna die,

1274
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:43,680
而且我要死得比我想象的要早得多
and I'm gonna die much sooner than I had imagined.

1275
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:47,140
天哪
Oh, my goodness.

1276
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:50,480
我知道  亲爱的
I know, dear.

1277
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,650
他在说什么
What is he talking about?

1278
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:56,150
所以在准备面对死亡的过程中
So in preparing for what lies ahead,

1279
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,860
我开始意识到我这辈子大部分的时间里
I've come to realize that for much of my life,

1280
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,820
我都被错付了
I've been mistaken,

1281
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,350
我还失败了
and I failed.

1282
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:11,460
我不仅没能领悟生命是有限的
I failed, not only to comprehend my mortality,

1283
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:14,210
还没能珍惜它
but I've failed to appreciate it.

1284
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,590
因此
And as a result,

1285
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:22,130
我没能充分利用自己的生命
I've failed to make the most of my life.

1286
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:26,620
维罗妮卡  你是个厉害的角色
Veronica, you're one hell of a sport.

1287
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:30,140
你是个非常值得尊敬的对手
You are a very worthy adversary.

1288
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:31,730
我很骄傲
Proud...

1289
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,400
自己能够把你称作我的妻子
to have been able to call you my wife.

1290
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,780
因为如果没有你  生活将会
Because life without you would've been,

1291
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,530
黯淡无光
far less rich.

1292
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,360
为此  我感谢你
And for that, I thank you.

1293
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,160
无论如何
For whatever it's worth...

1294
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:53,250
我爱你
I love you...

1295
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:55,290
非常爱
deeply.

1296
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,090
我知道
I know.

1297
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:06,800
我们背叛了自己肩负的最重要的责任
We've turned our backs on the most important duty that we possess,

1298
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:10,720
那就是过上我们自己选择的
to live a life that is rich in experience

1299
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:15,810
精彩丰富的一生
that's of our own independent choosing.

1300
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:19,520
抓住自己的时间  各位
Seize your fucking existence, folks.

1301
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:22,880
为什么不让死神做我们最亲密的伙伴
Why don't we make death our closest fucking companion,

1302
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,930
这样我们才终于有那么一秒
so that we can finally have a second,

1303
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:29,120
有那么一毫秒来享受
a millisecond to appreciate

1304
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,160
我们剩下的那点时间
that little bit of time that we have left.

1305
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:34,370
最重要的是
And most important of all,

1306
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,250
让我们活得痛快
let us live well,

1307
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:39,840
这样我们才能死得痛快
so that we may fucking die well,

1308
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:43,090
因为我们从未像此刻这样
because we've never been so close to death

1309
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:45,340
如此接近死亡
than this very moment.

1310
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,390
干杯
Cheers.

1311
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,270
该死的  理查德  那可是水晶做的
Dammit, Richard. Those are crystal.

1312
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:05,590
{\an8}第六章
道别时刻

1313
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:24,070
很抱歉让你以这种方式知道真相
I'm so sorry that you had to find out like that,

1314
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:25,420
我只是不知道
and I just didn't...

1315
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:28,360
我真的不知道该怎么告诉你
I mean, I honestly didn't know how to tell you.

1316
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,550
我很害怕
I was scared.

1317
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:33,930
你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do?

1318
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,690
我打算离开  亲爱的
I'm gonna leave, sweetheart.

1319
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,810
我就是这么打算的
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1320
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,450
拜托了  努力去追寻幸福
Please, try and find some happiness.

1321
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,450
我在努力
I'm working on it.

1322
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,160
我知道你会找到的
I know you will.

1323
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:03,420
再见  理查德
Goodbye, Richard.

1324
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:26,780
再见  维罗妮卡
Goodbye, Veronica.

1325
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,280
拜
Bye.

1326
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,780
奥丽维娅
Olivia?

1327
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,780
你怎么回来了  宝贝
What are you doing home, baby?

1328
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,490
泰勒跟我分手了
Taylor broke up with me.

1329
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:16,160
什么
What?

1330
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:19,200
她把我甩了跟奈森·朗宁斯在一起了
She cheated on me with Nathan Runnings.

1331
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:22,670
朗宁斯教授的孩子
Professor Runnings' kid?

1332
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,090
听着
Listen.

1333
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,510
好了  宝贝  过来
Come on, babe. Come here.

1334
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:37,680
过来
Come here.

1335
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,980
不用担心  亲爱的  你会没事的
Don't worry, sweetheart. You're gonna be fine.

1336
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,730
这世界上有很多女人
The world's full of women

1337
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:48,320
都在寻找自己的另一半
looking for someone to love.

1338
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,190
会有一个人值得你去爱
There's gotta be somebody who deserves you.

1339
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,740
你想喝点什么
What'll you have?

1340
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,870
随便吧
I don't care.

1341
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:00,810
男人失去女人的时候
Well, when a man loses a woman,

1342
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:03,830
通常  他会喝威士忌
it's, typically whiskey he drinks.

1343
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,710
所以
So,

1344
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,800
我就推测
I'm kind of assuming that,

1345
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,180
同性恋也会这样
a lesbian would do the same.

1346
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:32,860
敬你的未来
Here's to your future.

1347
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:36,740
敬你无比光明的未来
To your bright, bright future.

1348
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,030
敬下地狱的泰勒
To Taylor rotting in hell.

1349
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,200
没错  敬下地狱的泰勒
And yes, to Taylor rotting in hell.

1350
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,120
干杯
Cheers.

1351
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,720
我真的好为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1352
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:03,890
为什么
Why?

1353
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:10,770
因为你拥有着
Because you possess everything

1354
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:16,740
一个父亲能期望自己的女儿所能拥有的一切
that a father could ever want in a daughter, and more.

1355
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:19,120
甚至更多
So much more.

1356
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,000
爸爸
Dad.

1357
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:31,960
怎么了  宝贝
Yeah, baby?

1358
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,430
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1359
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:48,310
我病了  奥丽维娅
I'm sick, Olivia.

1360
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:51,560
我病了
I'm sick.

1361
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:58,780
你还会好起来吗
Are you gonna be okay?

1362
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,460
不会了
No.

1363
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:12,320
没事的
It's all right.

1364
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,850
没事的
It's all right.

1365
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:19,590
你会没事的  听见了吗
You're gonna be all right. Do you hear me?

1366
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:22,600
你会很棒的
You're gonna be great.

1367
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,320
我要离开一段时间
I'm gonna need to go away for a little bit.

1368
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,690
你要去哪
Where are you going?

1369
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,410
我也不知道
I don't really know.

1370
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,790
我只是有些事想在路上弄明白
I just got some things I gotta figure out.

1371
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:16,940
我非常爱你  我的女儿
I love you so much, my girl.

1372
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:19,860
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1373
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,990
你要继续走自己的这条路
You stay on this path of yours.

1374
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:25,740
听见了吗
You hear me?

1375
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:29,000
你要继续走这条属于自己的路
You stay on this path that's yours.

1376
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,330
你做得很对  孩子
You're doing it right, kid.

1377
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:46,260
我会非常想你的
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1378
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,100
我爱你
I love you.

1379
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,190
吉宝
Jibbles,

1380
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,770
咱们上路吧
let's hit the road.

01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,330
好孩子
Good boy.

1383
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:24,930
你要确保让你妈妈照顾好你
You make sure your mom takes good care of you, huh?

1384
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:29,310
我能照顾好我自己
I can take care of myself.

1385
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,940
我毫不怀疑  孩子
I have no doubt about that, kid.

1386
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:38,430
抱歉  吉宝
